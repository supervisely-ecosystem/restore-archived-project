## Troubleshooting

The best way to solve problems is to follow the steps described below.

1. Check logs   
    - Go to [Workspace Tasks](https://app.supervisely.com/tasks) and find the last task for "Restore archived project" app. The most recent task is always at the top of the list.
    - If you have `Error` in the output column it also contains `Open log` (1) link. If no, click `‚ãÆ` (2) on the right and choose `Log`

2. If errors related to downloading or unpacking archives, other unexplained errors appear in the log, and they are not resolved after several restoration attempts, you can try to run "Restore archived project" using your own agent. To do this, you need to perform the following steps.

    - Set up the Agent on your computer
    - Go to [Workspace Tasks](https://app.supervisely.com/tasks)
    - Click the `‚ãÆ` button next to the problem task, then `Run Again`, and in the pop-up window, select your agent from the `Agent` drop-down list. `Run` the application
